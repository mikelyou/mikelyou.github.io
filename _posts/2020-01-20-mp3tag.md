## What is Mp3tag

Maybe you encountered this problem before, that you play music got from other place at media player, and you noticed the title is not the song's title, but `02` or something. This is because you only changed the `filename`, but not the `title` of this song.

If it is just one or two songs, you can easily right-click them annd change the `title` at `attributes` of those songs.

However, if you want to do this to multiple of audio files, it would take a long time. A useful tool would be very hulpful. So I tried to find how can I achieve this using Python, but I filed. There are no such articles or tools.

Due to my complainable searching ability, it took much time before I found the powerful, easy-to-use, small and mature software: [Mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/index.html).

If you are looking for such a tool, please go to their [website](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/index.html), where there are very clear description. This post will only record the functions that I am interested in.

## Application scenario

#### Replace titles with filenames

- First, drag the mp3 files into the user interface.
- Second, click `convert -> filename-tag`. And a window will appear.
- Third, select the tag we want to chage, `title`. You can preview the changes.

Done.

## Conclusion

- Don't try to use Python to do everything...
- Let the professionals do their jobs.
