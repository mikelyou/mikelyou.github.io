A brief summary of frequently used Latin phrases and abbreviations used in everyday life and math or physics fields. Some phrases or abbreviations are not concluded, just because I have never seen them before, thus classified as "not frequently used".

（常用拉丁短语和缩写，主要为日常使用和数学物理领域使用。一些短语没有列出，单纯是因为我没有见过，所以被归为“不常用”.）
