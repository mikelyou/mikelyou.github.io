**Friendly reminder**:
This series are my own study notes of several tutorials and articles, which will be listed below. I do not own copyright of some of the content. And I don't think this is good tutorial for others. I really appreciate it if you notice any mistakes or errors and tell me. Sorry that things copied from [Python-100-Days](https://github.com/jackfrued/Python-100-Days) will not be noted due to huge workload. **The whole series are not allowed to be reproduced**. View **[python-learning-readme](https://mikelyou.com/2020/01/02/python-learning-00-readme/)**.
