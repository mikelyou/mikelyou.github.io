**Friendly reminder:** This series are my own study notes of **[Python-100-Days](https://github.com/jackfrued/Python-100-Days)**. I do not own copyright of some of the content. Nor is this a good tutorial of Python. I really appreciate it if you notice any mistakes or errors and tell me. Sorry that things copied from [Python-100-Days](https://github.com/jackfrued/Python-100-Days) will not be noted due to huge workload. **The whole series are not allowed to be reproduced**.
