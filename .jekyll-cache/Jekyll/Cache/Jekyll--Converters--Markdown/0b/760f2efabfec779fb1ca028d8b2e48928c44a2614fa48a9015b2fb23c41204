<p>Maybe you encountered this problem before, that you play music got from other place at media player, and you noticed the title is not the songâ€™s title, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">02</code> or something. This is because you only changed the <code class="highlighter-rouge">filename</code>, but not the <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> of this song.</p>

<p>If it is just one or two songs, you can easily right-click them annd change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> at <code class="highlighter-rouge">attributes</code> of those songs.</p>

<p>However, if you want to do this to multiple of audio files, it would take a long time. A useful tool would be very hulpful. So I tried to find how can I achieve this using Python, but I filed. There are no such articles or tools.</p>

<p>Due to my complainable searching ability, it took much time before I found the powerful, easy-to-use, small and mature software: <a href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/index.html">Mp3tag</a>.</p>

<p>If you are looking for such a tool, please go to their <a href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/index.html">website</a>, where there are very clear description. This post will only record the functions that I am interested in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, drag the mp3 files into the user interface.</li>
  <li>Second, click <code class="highlighter-rouge">convert -&gt; filename-tag</code>. And a window will appear.</li>
  <li>Third, select the tag we want to chage, <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code>. You can preview the changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Done.</p>
