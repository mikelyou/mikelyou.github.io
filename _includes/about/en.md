Hi!

I am **Mike Lyou**, Master of **Materials Science and Engineering** at **Columbia University**, Bachelor of **Materials Physics** at **Sun Yat-Sen University**.

I have found knowledge of materials, together with some interests in electronics, cheistry and programming. I participated in **The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory** project as **Certified Assistant LabVIEW Development Engineer**, designed and programmed a software system for the Liquid Sentilator Filling and Overflow System based on LabVIEW.

I love literature, music and anime.

The purpose to build this blog is to find a place to post study notes. Writing blogs can encourages myself to learn more and maybe would help others as well. Hope this blog will help me and you. Comments are welcomed.
