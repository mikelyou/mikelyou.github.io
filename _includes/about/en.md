> Be myself and better than myself.

Hi! I am Mike Lyou, a second-year Master student, majoring in Material Science and Engineering (MSE) at Columbia University (CU).

I received my bachelor degree of Materials Science at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). Participated in The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) project, designed and programmed a software system for the Liquid Sentilator Filling and Overflow System based on LabVIEW. Received Certified Assistant LabVIEW Development Engineer (CLAD).

I love literature, music and anime, have posted over a hundred essays at WeChat Public Platform and several anime clips at Bilibili.

The purpose to build this blog is to find a place to post study notes. Writing blogs can encourages myself to learn more and maybe would help others as well. Hope this blog will help me and you. Comments are welcomed.
